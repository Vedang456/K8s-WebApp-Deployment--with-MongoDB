#Notes for User:
#Gives us the port number where container will listen 

# #Labels are for basically everything, you can label anything
# # Like a Added Identifiers, Used when we have multiple replicas
# of the pods. So basically Kube#rnetes gets to know which 
#pod belongs to which deployment we get that from the Matchlabels
